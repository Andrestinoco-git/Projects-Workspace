ONLINE RESERVATION SYSTEM

 * This is a program that asks the user to reserve seats on an airplane. The seats in first class are 1-5 and economy is from 6-10.
 * The user is asked to choose between first class and economy seating and assigns seating starting from 1-5 in first class, and 6-10
 * in economy. The user is also asked to choose if they want to continue to reserve more seating until all seats are reserved.
